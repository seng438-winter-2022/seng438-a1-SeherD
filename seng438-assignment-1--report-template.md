# Introduction

The purpose of this lab was to develop a smooth introduction to hands-on Software application testing. Through different testing methods, our group comprehensively tested a simple ATM, given a lengthy requirements list. In pairs, and as a team, we worked through exploratory, manual scripted, and regression testing to find a number of bugs in two versions of the application. This lab also introduced the group into bug tracking software Backlog. In different versions of the program, bugs found in either app version were comprehensively recorded for later reference. Though each member of the group had a strong foundation in developing and testing their own programs and assignments, following a scripted, and regression testing was very new to us. In the past, much of our testing has focused on a high-level exploratory testing. Furthermore, the bug tracking software was new to the group, but each individual was able to learn the software with relative ease.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

In the pair testing stage, our group was divided into pairs of two. In the exploratory testing, one partner recorded bugs into Backlog, while the other executed the testing plan on the ATM. Each pair identified a number of bugs, both common and unique to the other pair. Bugs were then compared in Backlog, and duplicates were removed. The team completed the regression testing on V1.1 of the program together, taking turns testing the ATM, and entering bug details into the log. This approach led to each member getting a chance to experience the various steps involved in testing, and to become familiar with the software. 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

During the testing of this interesting java ATM application, we ran innto a feww challenges along the way. One of those challenges was during the regression tests, when testing the ATM version 1.1, it was somtimes hard to remember what bugs existed in the ATM version 1.0, without having backlog open to look at. This just goes to show how important it is to record all the earlier bugs found, so you wont have to remember all of them and possibly miss some. Another challenge we encounterd as a group was when we split up into pairs for manual testing, sometimes we would report duplicate bugs.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

Tthe assignment was interesting, interactive, and at times challenging. It really gave us a taste of what its like to test a program. In terms of the instructions for the assignment. we believe, at some parts, the instructions were unclear, Mostly regarding splitting up into pairs.  It was hard to know how to merge our work, or if we needed to make two defect reports etc.
Overall Good Assignment.
